# Logistic Regression
</br> Logistic regression is a statistical method for analysing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine a binary outcome. Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm.
It predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is binary or dichotomous, i.e. it only contains data coded as 1 (TRUE, Success, Pregnant, etc.) or 0 (FALSE, Failure, Non Pregnant, etc.) We use dummy variables to represent binary / categorical outcome, for example we will use “1” for success in exam and “0” for failure in exam.
